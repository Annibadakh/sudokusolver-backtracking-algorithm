## Sudoku Solver

This is a Java application designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing, providing a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with the solver.

### Features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - The application offers a clear and interactive GUI, where users can input their Sudoku puzzles directly into a grid.
   - Once the puzzle is entered, users can initiate the solver with a click of a button, and the application will visually display the solution process step by step.

2. **Backtracking Algorithm**:
   - The core of the solver is the backtracking algorithm, a recursive method used to solve constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku.
   - The algorithm systematically tries numbers in each cell, backtracking when it encounters a conflict, until it finds a valid solution.

3. **Real-Time Visualization**:
   - As the algorithm works through the puzzle, users can watch the process unfold in real-time on the grid.
   - The solver highlights cells as it works, showing how it fills in the blanks and backtracks when necessary, providing insight into how the solution is reached.

### How It Works:

- The user inputs an incomplete Sudoku puzzle into the provided grid interface.
- Upon starting the solver, the backtracking algorithm begins filling in the grid.
- If the current number in a cell leads to a valid state (no conflicts with other numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid), the algorithm moves forward.
- If a conflict arises, the algorithm removes the conflicting number (backtracks) and tries a different number.
- The process continues until the entire puzzle is solved or deemed unsolvable.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand the backtracking algorithm or those interested in building interactive Java applications with a focus on problem-solving and visualization.
